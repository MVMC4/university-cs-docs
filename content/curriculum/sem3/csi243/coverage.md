## Laboratory coverage

| Lab | Source | Site location |
|---|---|---|

## Verification status

**Course GHC version: 9.10.3** (installed via GHCup, Windows x86_64).

Every fenced `ghci>` transcript in the chapter notes was extracted mechanically (337 claims
across 34 files) and replayed against GHC 9.10.3, each in an isolated GHCi process. Results:

| Outcome | Count |
|---|---|
| Matched exactly | 215 |
| Matched (error/exception text, abbreviated in the notes) | 13 |
| Matched (expected text contained in a longer real message) | 62 |
| **Verified total** | **290** |
| Bindings and `:{ … :}` blocks producing no output | 21 |
| Not auto-runnable (`:load`, `main`, `import`, `it`) — checked by hand instead | 17 |
| Genuine mismatches found and fixed | 4 |
| Non-terminating by design, deliberately not executed | 1 |

| Chapter | Verified / runnable |
|---|---|
| 01 Functional Thinking | 1 / 1 |
| 02 Haskell Basics | 32 / 34 |
| 03 Functions & I/O | 14 / 14 |
| 04 Making Choices | 29 / 29 |
| 05 Recursion | 21 / 21 |
| 06 Lists, Tuples & Comprehensions | 55 / 59 |
| 07 Higher-Order Functions | 62 / 62 |
| 08 Modules & Custom Types | 24 / 26 |
| 09 Polymorphism & Type Classes | 45 / 46 |
| 10 Reasoning, Testing & Revision | 7 / 7 |

### Corrections made as a result

1. **`tuples.mdx`** — `:type` reported `(Num a) => (a, String, String)`; GHC 9.10 prints the
   single constraint without parentheses. Corrected to `Num a =>`.
2. **`first-program.mdx` and `modules.mdx`** — both claimed GHC *rejects* a file whose module
   name differs from its file name. It does not: such a file loads and compiles fine. The rule
   only bites when another module `import`s it, because GHC locates a module by filename, and
   the error then appears in the *importing* file. Both callouts, the error table, and the two
   practice questions were rewritten against the real behaviour.
3. **`modules.mdx`** — the two-module load shows `[1 of 3]` / `[2 of 3]` on GHC 9.10, not
   `[1 of 2]` / `[2 of 2]`.
4. **`ghci.mdx`** — GHC 9.10 opens with a plain `ghci>` prompt, not `Prelude>`. The section now
   leads with the current behaviour and explains `Prelude>` as what the lecture slides show.

Also added: a callout in `lists.mdx` recording that GHC 9.8+ emits a `-Wx-partial` warning on
*every* use of `head`, including successful ones — students will meet it immediately, and it
reinforces the partial-function point that section makes.

### Verified by hand (not auto-runnable)

- `:load` → `main` → edit → `:reload` cycle.
- `runhaskell Cube.hs`.
- `ghc -o cube Cube.hs`, producing `[1 of 2] Compiling Main` / `[2 of 2] Linking cube.exe`,
  a working executable, and the `.o` and `.hi` artefacts.
- The two-module `MyCalculator` / `MainModule` program, including `averageTwo 24 67` → `45.5`
  and `addTwo 89 23` → `112`.
- The `getLine` / `read` / `show` pipeline in `input-processing.mdx`, driven from stdin.
- Exception wording for `head []`, `maximum []`, `!!` out of range, and `read "four"`.

## Outstanding work

- Decide whether Lab 1 Task 5 (the Hello World comparison) should also appear as an exercise in `notes/first-program`.
- Consider a capstone integrating modules, custom types, and IO once units 00–10 are verified.

## Completion gates

- Every code example is compiled with the selected course GHC version.
- Every displayed output is captured from a real run.
- Each lesson answers what, why, when, when not, and how.
- Each lesson includes a comparison, a worked trace, common errors, guided practice, independent practice, and a mastery check.
- Current and archived resources are visibly separated on the site and in the Semester 3 vault.
- The portable vault note is published only after the site lesson passes academic and technical review.
